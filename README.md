embedded C

Hi Friends!!! In this project i have included a simple embedded C code for using GLCD, CLCD, and LED display and navigation on touch in GLCD(Touch screen). I tried this code in UTLP kit(owned by WIPRO) and it worked. I have included only the source code and have your own files for images uses in the code.
